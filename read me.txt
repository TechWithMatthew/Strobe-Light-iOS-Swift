\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hello, I\'92m very happy to see that you downloaded my Strobe Light project. I made this app simply for learning purposes and because I think strobe lights are kinda cool. This app as it sits is far from perfect, but I plan to continue to make changes to it. I wanted to make it open source just because I think its a really cool app and I would like to see other people make it their own.\
\
This is the first thing I\'92ve ever made open source so I\'92m kinda a noob at this and I\'92m still pretty much a noob at programming. \
