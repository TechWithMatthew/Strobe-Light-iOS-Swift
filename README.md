# Strobe-Light-iOS-Swift
This is simply a little strobe light app that I made, it also features "fast flash" for shorter light blast with longer light silences.

Hello, I’m very happy to see that you downloaded my Strobe Light project. I made this app simply for learning purposes and because I think strobe lights are kinda cool. This app as it sits is far from perfect, but I plan to continue to make changes to it. I wanted to make it open source just because I think its a really cool app and I would like to see other people make it their own.

This is the first thing I’ve ever made open source so I’m kinda a noob at this and I’m still pretty much a noob at programming.
